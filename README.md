I have added the `/register` and `/deregister` commands, they may be slightly buggy but my early testing says they worked mostly ok!

## Changelog 12

BIG NEWS <@&1248737660315635754>s!

So i've been doing a TON of stuff under the hood, mainly.. cleaning up old code XD

I was spending more time chasing bugs than i was actually playing with new features!
Speaking of features.. i now have a much more robust feature system! that actually ties into
the database backend at LAST finally bringing the yaml and dynamic db together!

This means 2 things,

1) I can get back to work on more fun things!
2) The bot can live on *your* servers now! Since configuration is now done on a per-guild basis

PM me for the bot invite!


## Changelog 13

Bot will no longer reply ðŸ’Ž when auto-upload is not enabled for a channel.

SauceNAO now configured for auto-upload with enhanced confirmation! (feedback welcome)

Fixed a few background task regressions.


## Changelog 14

Removed/unhooked booru functions from the main bot.
